# CGanTransformers

The aim of this project is to combine perform symbollic style transform of MIDI formatted music into NES style video game music.

The project demonstrates a novel application of CycleGans for this purpose, viewing musical style transfer as a kind of unsupervised language translation.

Much of the code here is pulled from <https://github.com/aitorzip/PyTorch-CycleGAN> and <https://github.com/chrisdonahue/LakhNES>.
